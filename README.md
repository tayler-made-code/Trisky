# Trisky

Trisky is a discord bot that plays a modified game of 20 questions about magic cards.
The first iteration will be for only playable commanders, and then another version for any paper card not banned by the community.

# First create a virtual environment

```

## and activate it

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

# Install Dependencies from requirements.txt once you are in the virtual environment

```bash

```

## Additionally you can output the dependencies to the requirements.txt if updating anything

```bash
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
```
